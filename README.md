# Visual Studio Code Settings

This repository contains my preferred Visual Studio Code settings.

## Included Files

- [**extensions.json**](.vscode/extensions.json): This file lists all the extensions installed in Visual Studio Code. You can use this file to quickly set up your development environment with the required extensions.
- [**keybindings.json**](.vscode/keybindings.json): This file contains custom keybindings configured for Visual Studio Code. These keybindings can help improve your productivity by providing shortcuts for frequently used commands.
- [**settings.json**](.vscode/settings.json): This file contains various settings configured for Visual Studio Code. These settings include editor preferences, theme settings, and other customizations to tailor your coding experience.

## Usage

To use these settings in your own Visual Studio Code environment:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mkogerd/vscode-settings.git
```

2. Copy the desired files (`extensions.json`, `keybindings.json`, `settings.json`) to the `.vscode` directory in your project or directly into your global user settings.

3. Restart Visual Studio Code for the changes to take effect.
